# Elementor custom form submission with listing via child theme

* This repo shows how you can create custom forms in Elementor via shortcode functionality. You can see 2 different forms in `include/` directory
* These forms are useful with ACF plugin
* After submission of these form will insert data into the relevant post type
* Moreover, mail sent mechanism also handled by these forms. You can keep or remove it as per your requirement.
* Mail mechanism is based on template of ACF option page so you need to add some more ACF fields into option page like `mail_subject, mail_template, mail_send_from`
* There is already a developed functionality that used to approve a listing via mail link
